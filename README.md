# 📘 DSA_JAVA  

Welcome to my **DSA_JAVA** repository! 🚀  
This repo contains my solutions to the famous **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet** – implemented in **Java**.  

The goal of this repository is to:  
- ✅ Build a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- ✅ Practice **problem-solving** with clean and optimized Java code  
- ✅ Track my learning journey 📈

## 📂 Folder Structure  
Each problem is categorized according to Striver’s A2Z DSA roadmap:  

- 🔹 **Basics** → Patterns, Recursion, Math, Arrays  
- 🔹 **Sorting & Searching** → Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- 🔹 **Strings & Hashing** → Palindromes, Anagrams, Substrings  
- 🔹 **Linked List** → Singly, Doubly, Reverse, Cycle Detection  
- 🔹 **Stack & Queue** → Monotonic Stack, Sliding Window, Queue Implementations  
- 🔹 **Trees** → Binary Tree, BST, Traversals, LCA  
- 🔹 **Graphs** → BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, MST, Topo Sort  
- 🔹 **Dynamic Programming** → Classic DP, Knapsack, LIS, DP on Strings  
- 🔹 **Greedy & Misc** → Interval Problems, Bit Manipulation, Math Tricks

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PraveenKumarM17/DSA_JAVA.git

2. Navigate into the folder where the repo is cloned:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\....\Desktop\....\.....\Java\example.java\Basics

3. Compile any Java file you want to run, for example:
   ```bash
   javac Basics/ArmstrongNumber.java

4. Run the compiled Java file:
   ```bash
   java Basics.ArmstrongNumber

5. Repeat for other problems in the Basics folder or its subfolders.
